Scenario
In this scenario, I made an interview for BI Analyst position with internet provider Google Fiber’s customer call center. As part of the interview process, I have been asked to complete a fictional project. The project involves all the BI stages: capture, analyze, and monitor.
Project background
The team needs to understand how often customers again phone customer support after their first inquiry; this will help leaders understand whether the team is able to answer customer questions the first time. Further, leaders want to explore trends in repeat calls to identify why customers are having to call more than once, as well as how to improve the overall customer experience. I will create a dashboard to reveal insights about repeat callers.
